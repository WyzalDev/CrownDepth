  - Hello, i'm Demon. You have proven yourself as a king.
  - Would you like to try ruling underground?
  - You need to make evil choices and grow limbs that depend on the sins of the chosen
    cards.
  - As your limbs grow, you'll go lower and lower.
  - By going down to hell, you will prove your worthiness.
